# Binary Trees Project
> C, Group project, Algorithm, Data structure

## Overview

Welcome to the Binary Trees project! This is a group project designed to explore the implementation, algorithms, and applications of binary trees in the C programming language. This project provides an opportunity for collaborative learning and hands-on experience with one of the fundamental data structures in computer science.

## Project Goals

1. **Implementation**: Develop a comprehensive set of functions to create, manipulate, and traverse binary trees in C.
2. **Algorithms**: Explore and implement common binary tree algorithms such as tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), searching, insertion, and deletion.
3. **Data Structures**: Gain a deep understanding of the binary tree data structure and its variations, including balanced trees and binary search trees (BST).
4. **Group Collaboration**: Collaborate with your team members to share knowledge, solve challenges, and collectively build a robust binary tree library.


## Tasks
0. **New node**: a function that creates a binary tree node
1. **Insert left**: a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
2. **Insert right***:a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
3. **Delete**: a function that deletes an entire binary tree
4. **Is leaf**: a function that checks if a node is a leaf
5. **Is root**: a function that checks if a given node is a root
